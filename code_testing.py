def generalisation_N_dimension(dimension=2, radius=1, sample_size_N=10000):
    '''
    This function calculate abritary positive integer dimension of
    hypervolume sphere encased inside a unit confinement, using MC method.

    Important Info:
    -Unit Sphere -> Unit Radius
    -Concrete mathematics of Hypersphere:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-sphere

    Parameters
    ----------
    dimension : INT, optional
        This will be the positive integer dimension of the hypervolume. The
        default is 2.
    
    radius : Float, optional
        Radius of the sphere, default is 1 of arbitrary unit.
    
    sample_size_N : INT, optional
        This is the size of the sampling population. The default is 10000.

    Returns
    -------
    None
